Greetings! I'm Ruoyan, a PhD student in Planetary Physics at the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/planetary-science). My interests cover various aspects of planets, including both atmospheres and interiors. I focus on studying these celestial objects from an astrophysical perspective. In general, I am curious about any topics in planetary science.

## My work and research
Currently, I work on Jupiter’s auroral ionosphere and thermosphere with [Prof. Tom Stallard](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/physics/people/tomstallard). The aurora of Giant Planets are produced comes from indirect measurements of the bright auroral emissions observed in the poles of these planets and in-situ measurements of the surrounding space environment – these have suggested the aurora are driven by currents that result from the relative flow of molecules of ions and neutrals in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere. My work involves the reduction and analysis of infrared emissions from Jupiter’s upper atmosphere, using high-resolution spectroscopy from telescope instrumentation, including our existing library of observations taken by the NIRSpec instrument on the Keck telescope.

## My background and history
I received my BSc in Astrophysics at the [University of California, Santa Cruz](https://www.astro.ucsc.edu/), and my MSc in Astronomy at [Leiden University](https://local.strw.leidenuniv.nl/). 

## My personal interests
During my spare time, I travel around and record the beauty of this fascinating planet earth as a freelance travel blogger. Also, I'm a fan of basketball and soccer. Anyone is welcome to have a game with me!
