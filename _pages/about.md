Greetings! I'm Ruoyan, a second-year astrophysics graduate student at Leiden University. My research interests focus on all aspects of stellar and planetary sciences. 

Currently I work on cataloging and visualizing circumsstellar disks. It begins with designing an online
database containing observational and published results of scattered light imaging of these disks,
with a web interface for easy access and basic statistical analysis. Another part the project currently
ongoing is to create a simplified 3D reconstruction of disks from 2D data. The ultimate
goal is to design an efficient tool for researchers, which can be easily queried, maintained and
updated.

During my first year of graduate study, I spent my time on detecting transiting exoplanets near bright stars with MASCARA and TESS. My job was data-mining the TESS archive and searching
for candidates that MASCARA able to capture, and then analyzing the corresponding phase
curves for the long-term variability and revealing longer period planets. 

Before coming to Leiden, I received my BSc in Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, where I worked as an undergraduate researcher on atmospheres of brown dwarfs. This work included running models over
a large parameter space including effective temperature, metallicity, Carbon-Oxygen ratio, surface
gravity, and cloud thickness and species if models containing clouds. The vetting process emphasized on investigation of the radiative-convective zone via analyzing pressure-temperature profiles, thermal
spectra, and providing a pressure-wavelength relation by interpolating them with fluxes.

During my spare time, I travel around and record the beauty of this fascinating planet earth as a freelance travel blogger. Also, I'm a huge fan of basketball and soccer. Anyone is welcome to have a game with me!
