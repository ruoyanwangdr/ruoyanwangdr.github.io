Greetings! I'm Ruoyan, a PhD candidate in Planetary Physics at University of Leicester. My interests cover various aspects of planets, including both atmospheres and interiors. I focus on studying these celestial objects from an astrophysical perspective. In general, I am curious about any topics in planetary science.

Currently, I work on Jupiter’s auroral ionosphere and thermosphere with [Prof. Tom Stallard](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/physics/people/tomstallard). The aurora of Giant Planets are produced comes from indirect measurements of the bright auroral emissions observed in the poles of these planets and in-situ measurements of the surrounding space environment – these have suggested the aurora are driven by currents that result from the relative flow of molecules of ions and neutrals in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere. My work involves the reduction and analysis of infrared emissions from Jupiter’s upper atmosphere, using high-resolution spectroscopy from telescope instrumentation, including our existing library of observations taken by the NIRSpec instrument on the Keck telescope. 

I received my BSc in Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, where I worked as an undergraduate researcher on atmospheres of brown dwarfs with [Prof. Jonathan Fortney](http://www.ucolick.org/~jfortney/). This work included running models over a large parameter space including effective temperature, metallicity, Carbon-Oxygen ratio, surface gravity, and cloud thickness and species if models containing clouds. The vetting process emphasized on investigations of the radiative-convective zone via analyzing pressure-temperature profiles, thermal spectra, and providing a pressure-wavelength relation by interpolating them with fluxes.

After that, I moved to Europe and completed my MSc in Astronomy at Leiden University. During my first year, I spent my time on detecting transiting exoplanets near bright stars with MASCARA and TESS with [Prof. Ignas Snellen](https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~snellen/). My work focused on data-mining the TESS archive and searching for candidates that MASCARA able to capture, and then analyzing the corresponding phase curves for the long-term variability and revealing longer period planets. 

My second research was on cataloging and visualizing circumstellar disks with [Prof. Matthew Kenworthy](https://home.strw.leidenuniv.nl/~kenworthy/). It began with designing an online
database containing observational and published results of scattered light imaging of these disks,
with a web interface for easy access and basic statistical analysis. The second part was creating a simplified 3D reconstruction of disks from 2D data. We aim to design an efficient tool for researchers, which can be easily queried, maintained, and updated.

During my spare time, I travel around and record the beauty of this fascinating planet earth as a freelance travel blogger. Also, I'm a fan of basketball and soccer. Anyone is welcome to have a game with me!
