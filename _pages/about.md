Greetings! I'm Ruoyan, an astronomy graduate student at Leiden University. My research interests focus on all aspects of planetary sciences. Currently I work on cataloging and visualizing circumsstellar disks. During my first year of study, I spent my time on detecting transiting exoplanets near bright stars with MASCARA and TESS. Before coming to Leiden, I received my BSc in Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz, where I worked as an undergraduate researcher on modeling atmospheres of brown dwarfs. 

During my spare time, I dedicate to travel around the world and record the beauty of this fascinating planet earth as a freelance travel blogger. Also, I'm a huge fan of basketball and soccer. Anyone is welcome to have a game with me!
