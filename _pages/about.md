Greetings! I'm Ruoyan, an astronomy graduate student at [Universiteit Leiden](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/science/astronomy). My research interests focus on studying and searching for planets in other systems. Currently I work on detecting transiting exoplanets near bright stars with MASCARA and TESS. Before coming to Leiden, I received my BSc in Astrophysics at UC Santa Cruz and worked as an undergraduate researcher on modeling atmospheres of brown dwarfs. 

During my spare time, I dedicate to travel around the world and enjoy the beauty of this fascinating planet earth. Also, I'm a huge fan of basketball and soccer. Anyone is welcome to have a game with me!
