Abstract: Brown dwarfs are substellar objects connecting giant planets and low mass stars. The atmosphere of brown dwarfs determines the radiative flux emitted to space and their own cooling time. Our group focuses on modeling the atmosphere across wide ranging parameters, including temperature, surface gravity, metallicity, and chemical abundances. This poster reviews fundamental stellar physics, actual modeling procedures and some brief analysis, and concludes with some future plans.
