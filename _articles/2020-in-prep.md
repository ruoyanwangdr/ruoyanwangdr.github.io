excerpt: "The goal is to assemble a complete catalog of all such observation that were conducted and published to date. The catalog will be combined with a web interface for easy access and basic statistical analysis. The goal is on the one hand to design an efficient tool for researchers, which can be easily queried, maintained and updated, and on the other hand a visualization experience for a general audience. One possibility that can be explored would be the (simplified) 3d reconstruction of circumstellar disks from 2d data."
