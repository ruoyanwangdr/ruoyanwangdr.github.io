Abstract: We construct a grid of brown dwarf model atmospheres spanning a wide range of atmospheric metallicity (0.3x <= met <= 100x), C/O ratios (0.25x <= C/O <= 2.5x), and cloud properties, encompassing atmospheres of effective temperatures 200 <= T<sub>eff</sub> <= 2400 K and gravities 2.5 <= log g <= 5.5. We produce the expected temperature-pressure profiles and emergent spectra from an atmosphere in radiative-convective equilibrium. We can then compare our predicted spectra to observations and retrieval results to aid in their predictions and influence future missions and telescopic observations. In our poster we briefly describe our modeling methodology and present our progress on model grid construction, spanning solar and subsolar C/O and metallicity.
