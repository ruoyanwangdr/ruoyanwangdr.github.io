## Week 1 -- Beginning of the project
### September 20, 2019
Spent an hour today with Matt and Christian discussing the blueprint of this project. Feel really excited. Hope this year will go well.

### September 21, 2019
Worked on GSD.

### September 22, 2019
Worked on PSF and BPH. Started to learn how to create a database using Python from some videos and online tutorials. Still need to read more. 

### September 23, 2019
I found that latex typing works is actually a pretty good way to save papers, as I could erase my answers over and over again from those unfortunate mistakes. Categorizing protoplanetary disks is pretty fun in a sense. The curry soup served at the dinning hall today during lunch was awesome! 

### September 24, 2019
Spent an hour and half discussing with a bunch of people about a separation of variables in a distribution function of galaxies involving potential and velocities. Have no idea how RNA and protein folding work but still need to figure it out. Let me count what's left: Ciesa 2011, learning to make a database, PSF, GSD, a travel journal, and fixing my bike!

### September 26, 2019
Today I went to a talk given by Rob Phillips about deciphering genomes. He was a great speaker. He summarized his job as to figure out a translation map so that people can read something in a language they don't know. I only wish that I could know more about biology to understand what he said. Also, something funny here. I was told that finding needles in haystacks is some sort of art. I have no comments on this subject. 

As for astronomy, I learned a bit about classifications of young stellar objects (YSOs) based on spectral energy distribution. Different classifications can be ambiguous depending on inclinations of YSOs. This is getting more and more interesting. I expect to finish several more chapters later on. 


## Week 2

## Week 24
### February 21, 2020

### February 24, 2020
Read about scattering phase function of disks.

### February 25, 2020
Worked on COP.

### February 26, 2020
Worked on AFS. 

### February 27, 2020
Milli et al. (2017) stated that their scattering phase function was derived based on two assumptions. One of them was the azimuthally uniform dust density distribution and identical dust properties. Explanations were that only the shape of SPF would contribute to any azimuthal brightness variation along the ring, after correcting for the distance between the scatterers and the star, the ADI flux loss and the convolution by the PSF. Not quite sure the reason behind. 


### Week 25
### February 28, 2020
Matt explained to me the question I proposed. If the disk is uniformly distributed with identical dust properties, the only reason that the disk looks differently in brightness is isotropy. It's the shape of SPF, rather than the disk. Now this is clear. The next step is to test the Henyey-Greenstein scattering function, recreate the disk to a ring, and implement the function to the new ring. 

### February 29, 2020
Worked on SPF.

### March 1, 2020
Worked on COP.

### March 2, 2020
Worked on AFS.
