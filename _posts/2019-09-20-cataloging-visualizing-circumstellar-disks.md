## Week 1 --Beginning of the project
### September 20, 2019

Spent an hour today with Matt and Christian discussing the blueprint of this project. Feeling really excited. Got a 50-page paper to read ~~. Hopefully this year can go well.

### September 21, 2019

Had shawarma today at the market. Later spent the entire afternoon working on GSD assignment. Video chatted with mom and dad. Gonna continue working on schoolworks.

### September 22, 2019

Worked on PSF and BPH today. Started to learn how to create a database using Python from some videos and online tutorials. Still need to the research paper more. 


### September 23, 2019

I found that latex typing works is actually a pretty good way to save papers, as I could erase my answers over and over again from those unfortunate mistakes. Categorizing protoplanetary disks is pretty fun in a sense. The curry soup served at the dinning hall today during lunch was awesome! 


### September 24, 2019

Spent an hour and half discussing with a bunch of people about a separation of variables in a distribution function of galaxies involving potential and velocities. Have no idea how RNA and protein folding work but still need to figure it out. Let me count what's left: Ciesa 2011, learning to make a database, PSF, GSD, a travel journal, and fixing my bike! Ah I wish I could control time.

### September 26, 2019

Today I went to a talk given by Rob Phillips about deciphering genomes. He was a great speaker. He summarized his job as to figure out a translation map so that people can read something in a language they don't know. I only wish that I could know more about biology to understand what he said. Also, something funny here. I was told that finding needles in haystacks is some sort of art. I have no comments on this subject. 

As for astronomy, I learned a bit about classifications of young stellar objects (YSOs) based on spectral energy distribution. Different classifications can be ambiguous depending on inclinations of YSOs. This is getting more and more interesting. I expect to finish several more chapters later on. 



## Week 2
### September 27, 2019

Technology can bridge up science with publics. I'm gonna learn Djanbo and Three.js in the next couple of weeks or so, in order to build a database and a playable 3D geometry. I can't wait to see this exciting result comes through. 

Also, Friday belongs to the basketball night. "Nothing but the bottom of the net" will summarize my performance. 


### September 28, 2019

Worked on GSD and watched tutorial for Django for a bit. I cooked beef ball ramen today and it was delicious! That sort of compensated this boring Saturday.


### September 29, 2019

Did not work on anything substantially. 


### September 30, 2019

Spent a hell long time on a integral. I might need to retake some math classes. 

### October 1, 2019

Graphically, dark color backgrounds look cooler to me. Learning a new programming language really takes some efforts. How to get better? We are talking about PRACTICE man!

### October 2, 2019

At least the sun came out today. To be frank, I could not see the point of putting peanut butter sauce into everything. Relief of Leiden is tomorrow. I am going for a vacation. 


## Week 3
### October 7, 2019

Watched several more tutorial videos for django. Also read some stuff for courseworks.


### October 8, 2019

Did some grad app researches. 


### October 9, 2019

Worked on my js model and GSD homework. Watched Ad Astra tonight with some other Sterrewacht people. The lines are good but the plot does not make sense. 


### October 10, 2019

I created a disk catalog web framework today. For now it contains an object name and its corresponding category. The admin interface has been also updated.


## Week 4
### October 11, 2019

Created subviews under disk sessions, plus a template for the database. Need to add some details about all the disks. 


### October 12, 2019

Worked on GSD assignment and did some researches for grad schools. 

### October 13, 2019

Trying to add disk details as subviews.

### October 14, 2019

The previous online table was very unstable when adding in large datasets. Very high probability of crushing. Also having trouble ordering the items. Rewrote the structure with different templates. 

### October 15, 2019

Spent most of my time on GSD and BHP assignments. 

### October 16, 2019

Met with Matt today and talked about the next step. Need some minor fixes for the table. Also, a function to read in .txt or .csv files for massive data for the input. Gonna start playing around with 3D models.

### October 17, 2019

Worked on GSD, BHP, and PFS. 


## Week 5
### October 18, 2019

Worked on BHP.
