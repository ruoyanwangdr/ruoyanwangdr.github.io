## Week 1 -- Beginning of the project
### September 20, 2019
Spent an hour today with Matt and Christian discussing the blueprint of this project. Feeling really excited. Hope this year will go well.

### September 22, 2019
Worked on PSF and BPH. Started to learn how to create a database using Python from some videos and online tutorials. Still need to read the paper more. 

### September 23, 2019
I found that latex typing works is actually a pretty good way to save papers, as I could erase my answers over and over again from those unfortunate mistakes. Categorizing protoplanetary disks is pretty fun in a sense. The curry soup served at the dinning hall today during lunch was awesome! 

### September 24, 2019
Spent an hour and half discussing with a bunch of people about a separation of variables in a distribution function of galaxies involving potential and velocities. Have no idea how RNA and protein folding work but still need to figure it out. Let me count what's left: Ciesa 2011, learning to make a database, PSF, GSD, a travel journal, and fixing my bike!

### September 26, 2019
Today I went to a talk given by Rob Phillips about deciphering genomes. He was a great speaker. He summarized his job as to figure out a translation map so that people can read something in a language they don't know. I only wish that I could know more about biology to understand what he said. Also, something funny here. I was told that finding needles in haystacks is some sort of art. I have no comments on this subject. 

As for astronomy, I learned a bit about classifications of young stellar objects (YSOs) based on spectral energy distribution. Different classifications can be ambiguous depending on inclinations of YSOs. This is getting more and more interesting. I expect to finish several more chapters later on. 


## Week 2
### September 27, 2019
Technology can bridge up science with publics. Gonna learn Djanbo and Three.js in the next couple of weeks or so, in order to build a database and a playable 3D geometry. 

### September 28, 2019
Worked on GSD and watched tutorial for Django for a bit. I cooked beef ball ramen today and it was delicious. That sort of compensated this boring Saturday.

### September 29, 2019
Did not work on anything substantially. 

### September 30, 2019
Spent a hell long time on an integral. I might need to retake some math classes. 

### October 1, 2019
Graphically, dark color backgrounds look cooler to me. Learning a new programming language really takes some efforts. How to get better? We are talking about PRACTICE man!

### October 2, 2019
At least the sun came out today. To be frank, I could not see the point of putting peanut butter sauce into everything. Relief of Leiden is tomorrow. I am going for a vacation. 


## Week 3
### October 7, 2019
Watched several more tutorial videos for Django. Read some stuff for courseworks.

### October 8, 2019
Did some grad app researches. 

### October 9, 2019
Worked on my js model and GSD homework. Watched Ad Astra tonight with some other Sterrewacht people. The lines are good but the plot does not make sense. 

### October 10, 2019
Created a disk catalog web framework today. For now it contains an object name and its corresponding category. The admin interface has been also updated.


## Week 4
### October 11, 2019
Created subviews under disk sessions, plus a template for the database. Need to add some details about all the disks. 

### October 12, 2019
Worked on GSD assignment and did some researches for grad schools. 

### October 13, 2019
Trying to add disk details as subviews.

### October 14, 2019
The previous online table was very unstable when adding in large datasets. Very high probability of crushing. Also having trouble ordering the items. Rewrote the structure with different templates. 

### October 15, 2019
Spent most of my time on GSD and BPH assignments. 

### October 16, 2019
Met with Matt today and talked about the next step. Need some minor fixes for the table. Also, a function to read in .txt or .csv files for massive data for the input. Gonna start playing around with 3D models.

### October 17, 2019
Worked on GSD, BPH, and PFS. 


## Week 5
### October 18, 2019
Worked on BPH.

### October 19, 2019

### October 20, 2019
Finished BPH. 

### October 21, 2019
Worked on PFS. 

### October 22, 2019
Worked on GSD and PFS. Changed font styles of input data to null and redesigned the table format to be Bootstrap 4. Still need to reconstruct the database and reboot the webpage. 

### October 23, 2019
Worked on GSD and PFS. 

### October 24, 2019
Spent my trying to work out a way to host the server. Either convert the app into a static site or redesign the whole thing to be static.


## Week 6 
### October 25, 2019
Tried some simple js primitives. A cube can rotate now. 

### October 26, 2019
I had a feeling today that I would work on multiple tasks today since I had been procrastinating for too long, but everything turned out to be left untouched. 

### October 27, 2019
Worked on GSD, BPH, and PFS.

### October 28, 2019
Successfully reproduced the constructive solid geometry example in three.js, except the background plane not in grid. 

### October 29, 2019
Worked on BPH and GSD.

### October 30, 2019
Tried several distributions of the geometries in three.js. Worked on BPH.

### October 31, 2019
Created a holo disk in addition to the original one. Worked on PFS and BPH. 


## Week 7
### November 1, 2019
Met with Matt and discussed about web hosting. The next step is to add curvature to the disk and shade it. 

### November 4, 2019
Worked on GSD, BPH, and PFS.

### November 5, 2019
Worked on GSD and PFS. 

### November 6, 2019

### November 14, 2019
Redefined variables names in models.py to match with the requirements. Edited labels of rows and columns in .csv files to qualify for importing. Disk data imported successfully after several tests. The old table format Bootstrap4 misplaced the query button so replaced it by Material Design. Cleaned up the navigation bar. Added instructions for usage in the source git. References will be linked manually later. Still need some minor fixes, but the database should be ready for now.


## Week 9
