## The revolutionary 21st century
### September 27, 2019

Technology can bridge up science with publics. I'm gonna learn Djanbo and Three.js in the next couple of weeks or so, in order to build a database and a playable 3D geometry. I can't wait to see this exciting result comes through. 

Also, Friday belongs to the basketball night. "Nothing but the bottom of the net" will summarize my performance. 

## Boring time
### September 28, 2019

Worked on GSD and watched tutorial for Django for a bit. I cooked beef ball ramen today and it was delicious! That sort of compensated this boring Saturday.

## Lazy at home
### September 29, 2019

Did not work on anything substantially.
