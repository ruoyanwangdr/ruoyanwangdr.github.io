Woke up today at 4:15AM to catch a bus leaving for Petra. Ancient ruins and hot lands together render a beautiful picture of nature. Jordanian people are so kind and friendly that I've been asked for 5 times where am I from and then said welcome to Jordan my friend. This country deserves a five star on any rankings for travels. Deep in the desert, on top of a cliff, watching sunset somewhere in Wadi Sum is the highest level of luxury.
