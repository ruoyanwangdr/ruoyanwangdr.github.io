## Week 1 -- Beginning of my PhD
### September 28, 2020
Spent an hour taking the physics Induction A. Met some cool people. Read some plasma physics lecture notes for background theory. Forgot nearly everything learned in undergrad. Really need to recap. Hopefully, this will be a satisfactory year.

### September 29, 2020
Mandatory Induction B. Received useful information about required progress management of my project. Restarted reading Rosie Johnson's PhD thesis.

### September 30, 2020
Tons of emails to write and reply. Reading progress slowly proceeded. 

### October 1, 2020
Group meeting. Some supervisory documents to process. 

### October 2, 2020
Library induction. More documents of employment to deal with. More readings about planetary plasma physics. 


## Week 2
### October 5, 2020
Even more documents to process. Barely have time to read. The beginning stage is just a mess. 

### October 6, 2020
Arrived in Leicester finally after quarantine. The city looks pretty even during the pandemic. A bunch of things to figured out but more or less settled. Looking forward exploring a bit. 

### October 7, 2020
Got to know my neighbor who happens to be a really nice dude. Completed training analysis and challenging unconscious bias module. Read Rosie's thesis.

### October 8, 2020
Completed research integrity module. Read Rosie's thesis.

### October 9, 2020
Read lab manuals and instructions and prepared for lab demonstrating. 


## Week 3
### October 12, 2020
Studied the impact of the Sun's magnetic field to magnetospheres on terrestrial and Jovian planets. 

### October 13, 2020
Supervision meeting with Tom. Discussed details about progress assessment and next stage of study. Read for magnetosphere-Ionosphere coupling. 

### October 14, 2020
College Induction. 

### October 15, 2020
College Induction part 2. 

### October 16, 2020
Read for charged particle drifting. 


## Week 4
### October 19, 2020
Read Johnson et al. (2018) - Mapping H3+ Temperatures in Jupiter’s Northern Auroral Ionosphere Using VLT-CRIRES.

### October 20, 2020
Journal club. 

### October 21, 2020
Got myself familiar with the lab setup. Will start working as the lab demonstrator. 

### October 22, 2020
Substituted in for another lab demonstrator who was sick. Session went well and smoothly.

### October 23, 2020
Second lab session. Students often misplaced the positive and negative ends. 


## Week 5
### October 26, 2020
Lab session of my own to demonstrate. Read Stallard et al. (2016) - The Great Cold Spot in Jupiter’s upper atmosphere.

### October 27, 2020
Second lab session. Journal club. 

### October 28, 2020
Revised training plan. Read Johnson et al. (2017) - Jupiter’s polar ionospheric flows: High resolution mapping of spectral intensity and line-of-sight velocity of H3+ ions.

### October 29, 2020
Discussed papers to read during group meeting. Confirmed data directory. First session of Developing Teaching Practice 2020-21 SEM1. 

### October 30, 2020
Studied for Preparing to Teach in HE. 


## Week 6
### November 2, 2020
Grading. 

### November 3, 2020
Journal club. Studied for Preparing to Teach in HE. Grading. 

### November 4, 2020
Met with Emma, Henrik, and Tom at Victoria Park. It was nice to see and chat with these lovely folks. 

### November 5, 2020
Lab session to demonstrate. It's been years since the last time I played with circuits. 

### November 6, 2020
Second lab session. Had a nice conversation with my neighbors this evening. 


## Week 7
