## Week 1 -- Beginning of my PhD
### September 28, 2020
Spent an hour taking the physics Induction A. Met some cool people. Read some plasma physics lecture notes for background theory. Forgot nearly everything learned in undergrad. Really need to recap. Hopefully, this will be a satisfactory year.

### September 29, 2020
Mandatory Induction B. Received useful information about required progress management of my project. Continued reading.

### September 30, 2020
Tons of emails to write and reply. Reading progress slowly proceeded. 

### October 1, 2020
Group meeting. Some supervisory documents to process. 

### October 2, 2020
Library induction. More documents of employment to deal with. More readings about planetary plasma physics. 


## Week 2
### October 5, 2020
Even more documents to process. Barely have time to read. The beginning stage is just a mess. 

### October 6, 2020
Arrived in Leicester finally after quarantine. The city looks pretty even during the pandemic. A bunch of things to figured out but more or less settled. Looking forward exploring a bit. 

### October 7, 2020
Got to know my neighbor who happens to be a really nice dude. Completed training analysis and challenging unconscious bias module. Read for research.

### October 8, 2020
Completed research integrity module. Read for research.

### October 9, 2020
Prepared for lab demonstrating. 


## Week 3
### October 12, 2020
Studied the impact of the Sun's magnetic field to magnetospheres on terrestrial and Jovian planets.
