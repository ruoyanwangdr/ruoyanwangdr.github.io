## Beginning of the project
### September 20, 2019

Spent an hour today with Matt and Christian discussing the blueprint of this project. Feeling really excited. Got a 50-page paper to read ~~. Hopefully this year can go well.

## I really don't wanna work on Sunday
### September 22, 2019

Worked on PSF and BPH today. Started to learn how to create a database using Python from some videos and online tutorials. Still need to the research paper more. 

## Not bad tbh
### September 23, 2019

I found that latex typing works is actually a pretty good way to save papers, as I could erase my answers over and over again from those unfortunate mistakes. Categorizing protoplanetary disks is pretty fun in a sense. The curry soup served at the dinning hall today during lunch was awesome!
