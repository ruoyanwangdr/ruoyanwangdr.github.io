excerpt: "First week since I began this research project. I must be honest that I didn't work much on it. Most of my days were spent on schoolworks and reading books and papers. Time is of the essence but I feel like I've run out of it already. "

## Beginning of the project
### September 20, 2019

Spent an hour today with Matt and Christian discussing the blueprint of this project. Feeling really excited. Got a 50-page paper to read ~~. Hopefully this year can go well.

## A usual Saturday
### September 21, 2019

Had shawarma today at the market. Later spent the entire afternoon working on GSD assignment. Video chatted with mom and dad. Gonna continue working on schoolworks.

## I really don't wanna work on Sunday
### September 22, 2019

Worked on PSF and BPH today. Started to learn how to create a database using Python from some videos and online tutorials. Still need to the research paper more. 

## Not bad tbh
### September 23, 2019

I found that latex typing works is actually a pretty good way to save papers, as I could erase my answers over and over again from those unfortunate mistakes. Categorizing protoplanetary disks is pretty fun in a sense. The curry soup served at the dinning hall today during lunch was awesome! 

## Where is my time?
### September 24, 2019

Spent an hour and half discussing with a bunch of people about a separation of variables in a distribution function of galaxies involving potential and velocities. Have no idea how RNA and protein folding work but still need to figure it out. Let me count what's left: Ciesa 2011, learning to make a database, PSF, GSD, a travel journal, and fixing my bike! Ah I wish I could control time.

## If only I can do it

## Just like trying to write poetry in Dutch
### September 26, 2019

Today I went to a talk given by Rob Phillips about deciphering genomes. He was a great speaker. He summarized his job as to figure out a translation map so that people can read something in a language they don't know. I only wish that I could know more about biology to understand what he said. Also, something funny here. I was told that finding needles in haystacks is some sort of art. I have no comments on this subject. 

As for astronomy, I learned a bit about classifications of young stellar objects (YSOs) based on spectral energy distribution. Different classifications can be ambiguous depending on inclinations of YSOs. This is getting more and more interesting. I expect to finish several more chapters later on.
