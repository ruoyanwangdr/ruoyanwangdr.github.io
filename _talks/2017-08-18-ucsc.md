Abstract: Brown dwarfs are objects that serve as the bridge between giant planets and hydrogen-fusing stars.The study of brown dwarf atmospheres involves sophisticated modeling procedures to produce the spectrum of radiation emitted by the objects via one-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium models. Challenges in modeling arise from their complex chemistry including molecule-rich atmospheres and cloud-forming condensates. Here we review progress on constructing a large grid of model atmospheres over a wide phase space.
