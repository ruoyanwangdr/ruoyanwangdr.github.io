This work included running models over a large parameter space including effective temperature (200 <= T<sub>eff</sub> <= 2400 K), metallicity (0.3x <= met <= 100x), Carbon-Oxygen ratio (0.25x <= C/O <= 2.5x), surface gravity (2.5 <= log g <= 5.5), and cloud thickness and species if models containing clouds. The vetting process emphasized on investigation of the radiative-convective zone via analyzing pressure-temperature profiles, thermal spectra, and providing a pressure-wavelength relation by interpolating them with fluxes. The goal is to compare our predicted spectra to observations and retrieval results to aid in their predictions and influence future missions and telescopic observations.
