excerpt: "<i>Graduate research; Researcher</i><br/>
Data-mined the TESS archive and searching for candidates that MASCARA could capture, and then analyzed the light curves for the long-term variability and long-period planets. Modified and performed the data reduction method to eliminate effects of local sidereal time and lunar saturation. Searched for direct transits using visual inspections and BLS detections. Ran signal recovery tests to characterize data calibration and performance of MASCARA as a transit survey."

The Multi-site All-Sky CAmeRA (MASCARA) and the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) both search for transiting exoplanets around bright stars. Synergizing the two telescopes allows for observations at high precision and revealing long-term variability simultaneously. One year of data obtained from MASCARA La Silla station are implemented with various calibration methods and the Box-Least-Square algorithm for visual and technical inspections. A potential candidate is visually detected orbiting the mV = 8.277 star HD 77113 (ASCC 1934956), but failed to be diagnosed by the BLS due to high noise level. Signal recovery tests to characterize the performance of MASCARA are done via injecting transits with different periods and transit depths. 10\% of signals have been captured at depth of 0.5\% for periods between 1 and 5 days. The minimum depth for BLS detection is noticed to become deeper as periods increase.
