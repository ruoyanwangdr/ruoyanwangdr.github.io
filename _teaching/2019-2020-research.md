excerpt: "<i>Graduate research; Researcher</i><br/>
Built an online web database to assemble a complete catalog of all observational and published results of scattered light imaging of these disks, with an interface for easy access and basic statistical analysis. Designed a simplified 3D reconstruction of disks from 2D data, providing an insight in the surface brightness and hence optical properties of dust grains."

We reconstruct circumstellar disks into 3D graphical models utilizing 2D scattered light phase functions both measured and simulated. Reproductions of surface light intensity are achieved by fitting the phase functions with two and three-component Henyey-Greenstein functions, as well as 7th order polynomials. Computed total intensity phase functions are multiplied with Rayleigh single scattering polarization to include the instrumental polarization introduced by the telescope optics. Two disk phase functions observed from HR 4796 A and HD 97048 and two simulated ones from the porous dust aggregate model are implemented to in total six disks. Among all, HD 97048 and MY lup reveal features adequately similar to the observations. A hypothesis is proposed as disks are fitted better by models with phase functions derived from other disks with similar ages, though not verified due to lack of samples and ambiguous impacts of disk properties. An online web catalog is then designed to simplify future investigations of relations between different disk parameters. Additional details to enrich the model are in demand for the next stage of development.
