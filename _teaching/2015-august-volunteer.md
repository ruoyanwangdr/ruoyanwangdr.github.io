Learned about the ecosystem of sea turtles and the balance between wildlife and human activities. Helped design a passive sonar to listen and record sea turtles during mating seasons, and also to observe their reactions to different musics."

In the summer of 2015, I joined Gapper International Voluntourism and spent a month at Galle, Sri Lanka. Unexpectedly, I got involved in a task designing a simple passive sonar to listen and record sea turtles during mating seasons, and to observe their reactions to different music. We employed the principles of stethoscopes and it turned out that both sea turtles and fish positively reacted to the relaxing and simple rhythms. During this volunteering I obtained a chance to apply my physics knowledge into substantial work.
