Introductory Physics III is a semi-mandatory undergraduate course in UC Santa Cruz&apos;s Physics Department, providing a wide overview to classical electromagnetism. I was one of the MSI tutors, responsible for helping students to acquire effective learning strategies, working with peers to understand difficult course material, and building relationships with their classmates.
