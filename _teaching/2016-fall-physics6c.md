PHYS 6C is an semi-mandatory undergraduate course in UC Santa Cruz&apos;s Physics Department, providing a wide overview to classical electromagnetism. I was one of the MSI tutors, responsible for helping students to acquire effective learning strategies, work with peers to understand difficult course material, and build relationships with their classmates.
