Using the 1-meter Nickel telescope, we measured Pluto's proper motion (how quickly it moves on
the sky) to determine its distance from the Earth. We then used the 3-meter Shane telescope with its adaptive optics system to measure the angular diameter of Pluto and the angular separation of Pluto's moon Charon. Combining these results, we calculated Pluto's physical diameter. With a little more ancillary data (Charon's orbital period), we calculated Pluto's mass and density.
